rules.

## Installation

The designer is part of PMD's binary distributions. To install a distribution, see the [documentation page](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_installation.html) about installing PMD.

The app needs JRE 1.8 or above to run. Be aware that on JRE 11+, the JavaFX distribution should be installed separately. Visit [the download page](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) to download a distribution, extract it, and set the `JAVAFX_HOME` environment variable.

If the `bin` directory of your PMD distribution is on your shell's path, then you can launch the app with
* `run.sh designer` on Linux/ OSX
* `designer.bat` on Windows


## Usage

TODO put usage doc on the main website


## Contributing

* Bug reports and specific feature requests can be submitted on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/issues).
* If you'd like to give usability feedback without a particular direction, or need some help using the app, please start a chat on the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/pmd/pmd-designer)

### Code contributions

* PRs are welcome anytime

#### Clean build from source

* Clone the repository
* Run `./mvnw clean verify`
* The artifact can then be found in the `target` directory

#### IDE Setup

##### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Clone the repository
1. Open in IntelliJ
1. [Open IntelliJ's terminal](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28044371/6245827) and
paste the following:
```shell
git update-index --skip-worktree -- .idea/misc.xml pmd-ui.iml # Ignore some config files
mvn process-resources # Generate CSS resources
```

4. [Synchronize the directory contents](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4599243/6245827) to pick-up on the new CSS files
1. Invoke the [Reimport All Maven Projects Action](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29765077/6245827)
1. You can now run the designer with the existing Run Configurations

1. Install the [File Watchers](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7177-file-watchers)
plugin to compile the Less files to CSS when you edit them. Configuration is already
in your repo because it was cloned in step 1. The CSS files are generated into an
ignored resource directory so that the integrated SceneBuilder picks up on them.


##### Eclipse

1.  Clone the repository
2.  Open eclipse, Choose "File, Import, Existing Maven Projects"
3.  Right click on the project, select "Run as, Maven build...", enter `process-resources` as goal. Run it.
    This generates the CSS resources.
4.  Open class `net.sourceforge.pmd.util.fxdesigner.DesignerStarter`. Choose "Run as Java Application".
